Usage
To run the application, start by executing the main.py file:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Components
Login (login.py)

Handles user authentication.
Ensure user credentials are set up correctly to allow access to the application.
Database Operations (database.py)

Manages connections and operations with the database.
Important to verify database connection settings to ensure smooth operation.
Main Application (main.py)

Acts as the main entry point of the application.
Orchestrates the initialization and execution of the different components.
User Interface (UI.py)

Contains code for the graphical user interface.
Likely uses ttkbootstrap to enhance the appearance of the UI.
Scanner Worker (scanner_worker.py)

Manages background tasks related to scanning.
Ensures that scanning operations do not block the main application thread.
.gitignore

Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, typically to prevent sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed to the repository.
LICENSE

Contains the license information for the project, detailing the terms under which the project can be used and distributed.
File Descriptions
database.py: This file is responsible for database-related operations. It likely includes functions for connecting to the database, executing queries, and handling data transactions.

login.py: This module handles user authentication, including verifying credentials and managing login sessions.

main.py: Serves as the starting point for the application. It initializes the necessary components and starts the application.

requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project, which need to be installed before running the application.

scanner_worker.py: Manages scanning tasks that need to run in the background, allowing the main application to remain responsive.

UI.py: Contains the code for building and managing the user interface of the application, likely using Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for a modern look.

License
The project is licensed under a specific license mentioned in the LICENSE file, which outlines the permissions and limitations for using and distributing the project.

##Quality Check

1. README.md
The README.md file typically contains the project's description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information. Let's inspect its contents to provide a detailed overview.

2. LICENSE
The LICENSE file contains the legal terms and conditions under which the project can be used, modified, and distributed. It is crucial for open source projects as it defines the permissions granted to users.

3. requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies required for the project. According to its contents, the project depends on the following packages:

ttkbootstrap: A theme extension for Tkinter, providing modern styling.
urllib3: A powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that adds image processing capabilities.
pyodbc: An open-source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple.
keyboard: A module for capturing keyboard input events.
4. database.py
This file likely handles the database operations for the project. It could include functions for connecting to the database, executing queries, and managing data.

5. scanner_worker.py
This script might be responsible for scanning operations, possibly involving data collection or processing tasks. It could be part of the backend logic, handling automated tasks.

6. ui.py
The ui.py file is probably related to the user interface of the project. Given the presence of ttkbootstrap in the requirements, this file might create and manage the GUI, providing an interface for users to interact with the application.

7. .gitignore
The .gitignore file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build artifacts, and other files that do not need to be version-controlled.

##Admin Panel

Overview
The application is a Tkinter-based GUI application that interfaces with a database. It includes functionalities for user login, displaying various operations (such as Receiving, Errors, Sorting, Shipping, and Labels), and handling user interactions through a graphical interface.

File Descriptions
app.py

This file defines the App class, which is a ttk.Frame based GUI application.
It sets up the main user interface, including various tabs and widgets.
The setup_ui method configures the UI elements and their layout.
The class interacts with a database through the DatabaseManager and displays custom messages using CustomMessageBox.
custom_messagebox.py

This file contains the CustomMessageBox class.
It provides static methods to show different types of message boxes (show_info and show_error) using Tkinter's messagebox.
database_manager.py

This file defines the DatabaseManager class responsible for database connections and operations.
It uses pyodbc for connecting to a database.
The class includes methods to connect to the database and execute queries.
Database credentials are fetched from user_credential.
login_window.py

This file defines the LoginWindow class, which is a tk.Toplevel window for user login.
The UI includes fields for username and password, and it verifies credentials using the DatabaseManager.
Upon successful login, it initializes the main application window.
main.py

This file is the entry point of the application.
It initializes the main Tkinter root window and sets up the application style using ttkbootstrap.
It creates instances of DatabaseManager, App, and LoginWindow.
The main window is hidden initially and shown only after a successful login.
README.md

This file provides instructions for setting up and running the application.
It includes commands to install required packages (pyodbc and ttkbootstrap).
It also outlines steps to run the application and interact with the user interface.
Functionality Workflow
Application Startup (main.py)

The application starts by running main.py, which sets up the Tkinter root window and initializes the DatabaseManager.
A theme is applied using ttkbootstrap.Style.
User Login (login_window.py)

The LoginWindow is displayed, prompting the user to enter their username and password.
Credentials are validated against the database using methods provided by DatabaseManager.
On successful login, the main application window (App) is shown.
Main Application Interface (app.py)

The App class sets up the main interface with tabs for various operations.
Each tab contains widgets such as buttons and checkboxes for performing specific actions.
The application interacts with the database to fetch and display relevant data.
Custom Message Boxes (custom_messagebox.py)

Throughout the application, CustomMessageBox is used to display information or error messages to the user.
Summary
The application is a structured Tkinter-based GUI that provides a tabbed interface for interacting with a database. It includes user authentication and various operations organized into tabs. 
The application is modular, with separate files handling different aspects of functionality such as database management, user interface, and custom message handling. â€‹
